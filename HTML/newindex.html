    <!-- Browsers do not always display the image referenced by the element. This is the case for non-graphical browsers (including those used by people with visual impairments), if the user chooses not to display images, or if the browser cannot display the image because it is invalid or an unsupported type. In these cases, the browser may replace the image with the text defined in this element's alt attribute. You should, for these reasons and others, provide a useful value for alt whenever possible.-->
