    <h1>Pagination 3</h1>
    <p>Pagination is a common UI pattern used to divide content into discrete pages, allowing users to navigate through large sets of data or content more easily. It typically involves displaying a limited number of items per page and providing navigation controls to move between pages.</p>
    <p>In web development, pagination can be implemented using various techniques, such as server
-side pagination, where the server sends only a subset of data for each page request, or client-side pagination, where all data is loaded at once and JavaScript is used to manage the display of items on different pages.</p>
    <p>Effective pagination can enhance user experience by reducing load times and making it easier for
users to find specific information. Common pagination controls include "Previous" and "Next" buttons, as well as numbered page links that allow users to jump directly to a specific page.</p>

    <a href="page2.html">2</a>
    <a href="page3.html">3</a>
